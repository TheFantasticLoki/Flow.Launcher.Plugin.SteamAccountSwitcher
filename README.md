# Original readme

## Wox - Plugin for Steam Account Switcher

### Inspiration
I have been using [TcNo's Acc Switcher](https://github.com/TcNobo/TcNo-Acc-Switcher) for a while and it has been very useful to me. It basically allows quickly switching between your steam accounts. I wanted to switch account faster using Wox.

### Requirements
This is a Wox plugin so it requires Wox to be installed, you can check [Wox.one](http://www.wox.one/) for an easy setup.

This plugin also requires [TcNo's Acc Switcher](https://github.com/TcNobo/TcNo-Acc-Switcher) to be installed. It is not configurable yet.

### Installation

As in any other Wox plugin, you simply run:

```
wpm install Steam Account Switcher
```
